# Statcast Player Projections

This repo is a bit of a mess right now. Sorry! I'll be organizing it and adding documentation (hopefully) before the end of the 2018 season.

The file with most of the analysis I did is "Statcast modeling.R". For the most part, the other files either define helper functions, create visualizations, or update my local data files (which are then copied to a Dropbox folder).

(details coming soon)
