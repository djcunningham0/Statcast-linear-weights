# Statcast-Enhanced Player Projections

This repo is a bit of a mess right now. Sorry! I'll be organizing it and adding documentation (hopefully) before the end of the 2018 season.

Statcast modeling.R contains most of my analysis. The other files are primarily used to define helper functions, create visualizations, or update my local data files (which are then copied to a Dropbox folder).

(details coming soon)

# R Shiny Web App

You can explore the projections and model predictions in my web app made with R Shiny:

I'll be adding more content and functionality on an ongoing basis.
